      <p> The side scroller I made on Scratch is named Doggy Dash. The motive of the game is to avoid the dogcatcher and the barrier so the dog will not get caught by the dogcatcher.</p>
    <h2 style="color:plum">Similarities and Differences between Python and Scratch</h2>
    <p>Python and Scratch are really similar because they use loops and many of the same blocks, however the way we set up the blocks and loops are very different. For example, if we want to say something without quotes then we have to use the "print" with paranthesis and quotes. Also if you want to the user to input something, you have to insert the word "input" and write the question in paranthesis with quotes. Also instead of using the "if then" loops in your codes to set up variables, you can simply set up an equality of the variable name and the value. Also words have to always be in quotes however if a number is put into quotes, it becomes a string. These are some of the many differences between Scratch and Python.</p>
